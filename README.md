# DPI-Fixer
Aim:
To fix Windows DPI issues when hotplugging monitors with different resolutions. DPI issues are most present in the Windows start menu as well as certain parts of internet explorer and Edge extensions.

Edge extensions' menu items will appear offscreen when moving from 4k resoluton down to 1080p.

Still seeking solution for DPI issues to fix dragging active windows between monitors before ending left-click action.
